Some language for the various Classes was derived from Alaska legal code so some relevant sections have been copied here for convenience. The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) also has a page on [Alaska Administrative Code](
https://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/AboutRCA/RCAStatutesAndRegulations.aspx) that describes regulations that apply to their authority.

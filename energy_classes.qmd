State of Alaska [Statute AS 42.05.990] (https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#42.05.990) includes the definition of utilities, several of which are related to energy: electrical service, steam, gas distribution and storage, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas storage. See{@sec-utility-definitions} for the text.

Of these, only electrical service was displayed in the dashboard of the previous version of AEDG, so these classes are all without AEDG precedent.

## List of Classes in the Wider Energy Context

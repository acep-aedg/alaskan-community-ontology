State of Alaska [Statute AS 42.05.990] (https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#42.05.990) includes the definition of utilities, several of which are related to energy: electrical service, steam, gas distribution and storage, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas storage. See @sec-utility-definitions for the text. Of these, only electrical service was displayed in the dashboard of the previous version of AEDG, so these classes are all without AEDG precedent.  Energy “public utility” or “utility”  includes every corporation whether public, cooperative, or otherwise, company, individual, or association of individuals, their lessees, trustees, or receivers appointed by a court, that owns, operates, manages, or controls any plant, pipeline, or system for
  
- furnishing, by generation, transmission, or distribution, electrical service to the public for compensation;
- furnishing steam to the public for compensation (grouped with water and sewer);
- furnishing by transmission or distribution of natural or manufactured gas to the public for compensation;
- furnishing for distribution or by distribution petroleum or petroleum products to the public for compensation when the consumer has no alternative in the choice of supplier of a comparable product and service at an equal or lesser price;
- furnishing the service of natural gas storage to the public for compensation;
furnishing the service of liquefied natural gas storage to the public for compensation;

As with electrical utilities, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) is one source of information on energy utilities, but the RCA regulates only a portion of existing energy-related entities in Alaska. Therefore each category below is divided into RCA resources and other sources of information. RCA search includes:

As data sources are identified, this section will evolve into regular classes and relationships.

#### RCA

- [RCA search](https://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/RCALibrary/SearchResults.aspx?t=cert&p=typesearch&cert=&entity=&utiltype=41ccfb21-50d0-481e-aaf3-bd9c73153227) for certificate numbers: 8 active state-wide, but only 2 big.
  - tariff filings (rate schedules)
  - RCA service areas (PDF and KML)
    - Enstar and its supplier Alaska Pipeline Company have separate service areas with the pipelines looking like rasterized lines.
    - IGU's is out of date because Fairbanks Natural Gas's service area is still separate but they merged in 2020.

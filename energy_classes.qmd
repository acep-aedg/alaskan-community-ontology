Unfortunately, without specific data sources to provide and constrain attributes, some classes and relationships cannot yet be defined within the context of AEDG. As data sources are identified in @sec-energy-data, this page will evolve. For now, it is incomplete.


## Fuel (not natural gas) {#sec-fuel}

### DCRA's Heating and Gasoline Surveys
- **Definition**: In 2005, the Division of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA) began collecting prices of heating fuel and unleaded gasoline in 100 select communities. The prices for heating fuel in these 100 communities are collected via a telephone survey of each fuel retailer. The communities have remained constant since the projectâ€™s inception and the reported prices should be considered representative of what a community resident would have paid for a gallon of heating fuel (including tax) on the day of contact. Values are also presented as averages for DCRA Economic Regions.
- **SpatialRelationships**: 
  - INTERSECTS Communities (as in only includes some)
  - Averaged into DrcaEconomicRegions
- **Analogous Standards**:
  - [OEO:gasoline](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000183) 
  - [OEO:heating oil](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000211)
  - [OEO:monetary price](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00020427)
  - [OEO:provider](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00140123) - A provider is an agent (organization) that transfers commodities, in this case fuel

State of Alaska [Statute AS 42.05.990] (https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#42.05.990) includes the definition of utilities, several of which are related to energy: electrical service, steam, gas distribution and storage, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas storage. See @sec-utility-definitions for the text.

Of these, only electrical service was displayed in the dashboard of the previous version of AEDG, so these classes are all without AEDG precedent.

## List of Classes in the Wider Energy Context

### SteamHeatUtility

- [RCA search](https://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/RCALibrary/SearchResults.aspx?t=cert&p=typesearch&cert=&entity=&utiltype=bcff05fe-74e7-4c68-b9a8-ca3469ef5f86) gives 3: Aurora Energy and Doyon utilities servicing Fort Greely and Fort Wainwright

    - Enstar and its supplier Alaska Pipeline Company have separate service areas with the pipelines looking like rasterized lines.
    - IGU's is out of date because Fairbanks Natural Gas's service area is still separate but they merged in 2020.
- EIA 
  - locations and owners of electrical power plants fueled by natural gas

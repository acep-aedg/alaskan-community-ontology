State of Alaska [Statute AS 42.05.990] (https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#42.05.990) includes the definition of utilities, several of which are related to energy: electrical service, steam, gas distribution and storage, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas storage. See @sec-utility-definitions for the text. Of these, only electrical service was displayed in the dashboard of the previous version of AEDG, so these classes are all without AEDG precedent.

As with electrical utilities, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) is one source of information on energy utilities, but the RCA regulates only a portion of existing energy-related entities in Alaska. Therefore each category below is divided into RCA resources and other sources of information.

As data sources are identified, this section will evolve into regular classes and relationships.


## Thermal (Steam, Waste Heat, Heat Recovery)

### RCA Regulated Steam Heat Utilities

- [RCA search](https://rca.alaska.gov/RCAWeb/RCALibrary/SearchResults.aspx?t=cert&p=typesearch&cert=&entity=&utiltype=bcff05fe-74e7-4c68-b9a8-ca3469ef5f86) gives 3: Aurora Energy and Doyon utilities servicing Fort Greely and Fort Wainwright

## transmission or distribution of natural or manufactured gas

What types of information is available?

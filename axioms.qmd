Axioms are domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.

  - Axioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include `x = y` and `y = z`, trying to enter an `x` that isn't equal to `z` would fail a test.
  - An Axiom should describe only one quality because it will eventually have a code-based test, and we want to keep those independent of each other.
  

## State
- The State is defined to be Alaska
- All Communities are in the State

## Community
- Communities are primarily determined by the expectations of the AEDG audience.
- Communities should be equal to a single entity (preferred)
- Communities could be collections of entities (example: Fairbanks should include College and Farmers Loop, which are separate Community Designated Places in the census)

## Indigenous 

- Tribes are nations and should be federally recognized (but sometimes are not)
- Native corporations are not nations, they are corporations that are a uniquely Alaskan entity. 
  - Gregory Ablavsky, Are Alaska Native corporations Indian tribes? A multimillion-dollar question, SCOTUSblog (Apr. 16, 2021, 8:18 PM), https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/04/are-alaska-native-corporations-indian-tribes-a-multimillion-dollar-question/ descibes an area where the distinction between tribe and corporation is murky.
- Native Village Corporations are not a subset of the Native Regional Corporations. They are a separate type of entity.

## Legislative Districts

- A Senate election district is composed of two contiguous house districts, if possible.
- Districts are redefined every 10 years after the federal census, and may change itermittantly due to court challenges.
- HouseDistricts can contain multiple Communities.
- A single Community might intersect several HouseDistricts (example: Fairbanks)
  - Therefore: HouseDistrict population cannot be determined from a sum of Community populations.

## Boroughs
- Communities can be unencorporated, meaning they are not in a Borough.
- If encorporated, a Community can only be in a single Borough
- There is one unencorporated Borough
  - The unencorporated Borough is split into CensusAreas for statistical purposes (not administrative)

## Census

- Census blocks are not permanent through the decades. If a block is split, a suffix is added to the block number.
- Census blocks are not required to have population. They could be water-only.
- Census blocks nest within a census tract. 
- Census tracks nest within state
- Census tracks nest within county, or the statistical equivalents of counties
- The optimum population of a census track is 4000 and the size is adjusted to accomplish that
- Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline.
- A Census Designated Place (CDP) can be located in more than one county (does that mean they might be in multiple census tracts?)
- A CDP cannot cross state boundaries.
- A CDP has a name that is different from adjacent places, but is not unique and can change.


## Zip Codes (Optional)
- A ZipCode can contain multiple Communities, especially in rural areas.
- A single Community can contain multiple ZipCodes, especially in urban areas.


# Energy-Related


## Grid
- Is a physical structure that supplies electricity to Communities
  - A Grid has the physical entities of PowerStations and PowerLines
- If isolated, is called a microgrid (check this)
- Can be composed of multiple Grids connected by interties
  - Interies are established on particular dates, so Grid definition can change over time
- A Grid generates power to supply a load.

## Utility
- A Utility can operate a single Grid (KEA)
- A Utility can operate multiple Grids (AVEC or AP&T)
- A Utility can operate a subset of a Grid. In other words, a Grid could be operated by multiple Utilities
  - The Railbelt is serviced by 5 different utilities: Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA), Matanuska Electric Association (MEA), Chugach Electric Association (CEA), Homer Electric Association (HEA), and the City of Seward Electric System (SES).
- Anchorage Municipal Light & Power (ML&P) used to make that 6, but they were absorbed by CEA
- Utility service areas are regulated by the RCA so they do not overlap.
- Utility service areas are measured in the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) - township, range, and section.
- Utility service areas are documented by the RCA with PDF maps. KML also?

## IPP
- A [Tribal Independent Power Producer (IPP)](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/Tribal-IPP-Development-in-Alaska_0.pdf) can develop and own renewable energy assets
- A local utility can buy renewable energy power from the Tribal IPP
- The cost of that power becomes a fuel cost that is an eligible PCE expense

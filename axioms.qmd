Axioms are domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.
  - Axioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include `x = y` and `y = z`, trying to enter an `x` that isn't equal to `z` would fail a test.
  - An Axiom should describe only one quality because it will eventually have a code-based test, and we want to keep those independent of each other.
  

## Community
- Communities are primarily determined by the expectations of the AEDG audience.
- Communities should be equal to a single Municipalities or VillageCorps (preferred))
- Communities could be collections of Municipalities or VillageCorps (example: Fairbanks should include College and Farmers Loop, which are separate places in the [wassit])

## State
- The State is defined to be Alaska
- All Communities are in the State

## Districts

- HouseDistrict is a subset of SenateDistrict (is this true?)
- HouseDistricts can contain multiple Communities.
- A single Community might intersect several HouseDistricts (example: Fairbanks)
  - Therefore: HouseDistrict population cannot be determined from a sum of Community populations.

## Boroughs
- Communities can be unencorporated, meaning they are not in a Borough.
- If encorporated, a Community can only be in a single Borough

## Census
- 

## Energy-Related
- Communities can be isolated (microgrids)
- Communities can be connected via Interties

## Zip Codes (Optional)
- A ZipCode can contain multiple Communities, especially in rural areas.
- A single Community can contain multiple ZipCodes, especially in urban areas.

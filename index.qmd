## Welcome  {#welcome}

This repository aims to support needed conversations regarding a foundational element of Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG): the creation of derived aggregates of socio-economic and energy data at upper levels such as administrative regions and grids.

To accomplish the computation of these aggregates in a reproducible way, a cross-walk between conceptual groupings of communities is required. This conceptual model will be applicable to diverse types of data. It will also guide the development of the algorythms that compute the aggregations and convert between them. 

If possible, this cross-walk will be machine readable/actionable. But to establish with consensus between our various subject matter experts, we need to start with a single set of definitions and axioms (rules) expressed in a human readable form. This could happen in a wiki, but we should maintain a record of revisions so we can document discussions and final recommendations. The best format for this process is a GitHub repo. 

## Goal

To provide a basis for tranformation of data provided at different scales so that multiple groupings can be displayed on AEDG dashboards. 

This is required because data will provided at different scales. For instance:

- Because of interties, electricity is not always reported by individual communities.
- Some ways of avoiding personally identifiable information (such as for building footprints) involve reporting by zip code.
- Existing analysis such as [somebody's] energy burden data is reported at census tract level.

Also, different audiences need data reported at different scales:

- Communities want a summary of their own data.
- Legislative Aides want summaries by legislative district.
- Agency leads might want to compare PCE communities with railbelt communities.

The assumption is that this needs to function **for the current time only**. Of course, boundaries change over time, and that these changes are of interest to researchers. However, the main users of AEDG have been defined as requiring current data to support future projects or to determine the success of existing projects. Researchers can download data and work out time-dependent issues for themselves. In a future time, we might want to support this with a time-dependent version of this system, but now is not that time.

## Format

Development will begin with a series of web pages oriented around ontological concepts. The concepts are:

- **Classes**: Types of entities. Most are defined according to existing legal structures as described in the linked references. The main exception is Community, which is the organizational principle of previous versions of AEDG; we will define that one ourselves.
  - Classes could be translated to tables in a relational database, if that makes sense for development. 
  - Instances of a Class are nodes in a graph, if you think about things that way.
- **Properties**: These are attributes of the Classes. 
  - Properties could take the form of columns in tables in a relational database.
- **Relations**: These can be heirarchical (taxonomy) or could form a network or graph (semantic web) of the various entities. If they are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), then that is what distinguishs an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.
  - Relations are the edges in a graph.
  - In a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.
- **Axioms**: Domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.
  - Axioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include `x = y` and `y = z`, trying to enter an `x` that isn't equal to `z` would fail a test.

## Anticipated Workflow

1. Liz will draft an initial version based on discussions at the Nov 11, 2024, meeting of AEDG personnel.
2. SMEs will comment on the draft by submitting GitHub Issues. Problems will be raised and solutions will be suggested.
3. When consensus has been reached (which might happen in an offline discussion), the resolution will be recorded in the issue, revisions made to this web book, and the issue closed.
4. After the most substantive discussions have been resolved, Liz will attempt to translate this ontology into the OWL ontology language.
5. If that does not work, we will try a relational database for consistency with other AEDG products.
6. If the concepts do not resolve into a relational database, we can try a graph database. We might want to leave this option open for visualization possibilities.

Whenever possible, we will rely on existing resources and resist defining our own ontology from scratch. Hopeful candidates are:

- Darwin Core
- [OBO Relations Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ro?tab=properties)

As of Nov. 2024, it is unclear how to make use of an OWL formated ontology with code. If this becomes problematic, we reserve the right to use a relational database instead based on our greater familiarity with that tech. Ontology specific work can be delayed to future development cycles.

    "text": "0.1 Welcome\nThis repository aims to support needed conversations regarding a foundational element of Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG): the creation of derived aggregates of socio-economic and energy data at upper levels such as administrative regions and grids.\nTo accomplish the computation of these aggregates in a reproducible way, a cross-walk between conceptual groupings of communities is required. This conceptual model will be applicable to diverse types of data. It will also guide the development of the algorythms that compute the aggregations and convert between them.\nIf possible, this cross-walk will be machine readable/actionable. But to establish with consensus between our various subject matter experts, we need to start with a single set of definitions and axioms (rules) expressed in a human readable form. This could happen in a wiki, but we should maintain a record of revisions so we can document discussions and final recommendations. The best format for this process is a GitHub repo.",

If they are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), then that is what distinguishs an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.\n\nRelations are the edges in a graph.\nIn a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.\n\nAxioms: Domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.\n\nAxioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include x = y and y = z, trying to enter an x that isn’t equal to z would fail a test.",

Hopeful candidates are:\nSchema.org is a widely used classification scheme built around web semantics - so more applicable to internet based services, of which AEDG is one.\nDublin Core Metadata Terms (DCMT) are limited to only the most necessary terms. For instance, dc:Location is defined to include both spatial regions and named places, and puts no qualifications on the type or context. Similarly, an dc:Agent is merely “a resource that acts or has the power to act”. Wikipedia says: “Initially developed as fifteen terms in 1998 the set of elements has grown over time and in 2008 was redefined as a Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary.”\nOpen Energy Ontology (OEO), which you access via this Terminology Service.\nThe Census Glossary describes the terms associated with the census.\nTerms describing Alaska Native representation are complex.

We do not need to have a lookup table of Communities in Boroughs, say, because we can select all the Community points that the Borough CONTAINS. The primary relationships are sketched out on the Classes pages, but the combinations are really unlimited.\n\n\n4.2.2 Lookup Tables\nSome classes are legal or corporate entities and so do not have an intrinsic spatial component. But they serve other entities that do have a spatial component, so we will use look-up tables to attach spatial info to them.\nTable names are very specific so that they describe the exact relationship between the entities. This will self-document the queries when those are written.\n\n\n4.2.3 Early ideas for lookup tables\nBefore we established the ELT pipeline or the application database, Liz theorized about potentially required tables. These have not been developed, but they do illustrate some interesting points so they have not been removed.\n\n4.2.3.1 provides_electricity_to\nUtilites provide electricity to Communities.

Interties are the physical power lines (transmission or distribution) that make the connection, but “intertie” is also the action of making two separate Grids into a new Grid. An intertie can be multiple lines going on different routes so if a geometry was defined, the line might be quite complex; for our puposes, we will start by representing interties with lines that join the Community points. Interties have a start date that could be defined in multiple ways - date of construction or date when billing changed.

Therefore, they aren’t the same as a Community but manage lands in possibly disjointed parcels inside and around the Community.\nThe DCRA dataset explicitly links these two with the columns EntityName and CommunityName. The addresses are for the corporate headquarters, which might be in Anchorage or somewhere, so those aren’t reliable links.\n\nAnalogous Standards:\n\nThe VillageCorp is an foaf:Organization that is foaf:based_near a Community - “A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.”\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://dcra-cdo-dcced.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/DCCED::native-village-corporations/ (215 records)\n\n\n\n\n\nid_near\nid_village_corp\nid_community\n\n\n\n\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger",

GVEA acquired the Frame 5 diesel fired generating units that were stationed adjacent to the FMUS Chena Power Plant from FMUS.\nBut GVEA did not acquire the big coal plant on the Chena river; instead Aurora Energy somehow came into being as an IPP, acquired this coal plant, and operates it now.\nGVEA is the final seller of electricity, or “Load-Serving Entity” (“LSE”), serving all of Fairbanks with some exceptions. GVEA only covers customers who have or pay for electric line extensions to their property/facilities. A number of customers within GVEA’s service territory continue to self-generate electricity in view of the expense of line extension costs. And for historic reasons, UAF and the militry bases generate their own power (see below).\nAdditional info:\n\nHenri Dale, retired from GVEA, will have details on GVEA’s acquisitions.",

    "text": "B.3 Are there other relevant entities?\nYes. Fairbanks has more “distributed generation” than other communities in part because of the evolution of the distribution of the power plants at UAF, FMUS, Ft. Wainwright, Eielson and later GVEA chasing diesel, HAGO, and naphtha generation resources at the North Pole refinery associated with TAPS completion in 1977.\nAdditionally\n\nAurora is a a certificated utility selling heat in some service territory defined by the network of steam [and hot water] pipes.\nThe Fairbanks Interior Gas Utility is certificated to sell natural gas to some service territory.\nUAF operates its own coal plant that makes electricity and heat\nDoyon Utilities is a generator operating plants on military bases\n\nAnd GVEA’s role is also convoluted: sometimes selling some electricity to the bases, sometimes buying electricity from UAF, and probably some other weird factors.\n\nB.3.1 Aurora Energy relation to Usibelli Coal?\nAurora Energy is listed as a customer of Usibelli Coal. Their 2011 Financial Statement filed at the RCA says that “The Company has similar ownership as Usibelli Coal Mine, Inc. (UCM), sole supplier of coal to the plant.” The GEM wiki says “It is a private company, owned by Joseph E. Usibelli, Sr., Joseph E. Usibelli, Jr., and Rosalie Whyel.”\nIn short Usibelli went up the value chain to own/operate the coal fired cogeneration power plant.\n\n\nB.3.2 A note on technology\nFor decades, Fairbanks used smaller scale wood and nascent oil/diesel. These were replaced with combined heat-power plants that imported stoker fired traveling grate coal feeds into a boiler technology adapted from the shipping industry that later converted to oil. Fairbanks imported this relatively efficient form of heat-power energy production roughly contemporaneous with WWII and the influx of federal Department of Defense money. The steam distribution systems also provided humidification in the dry winter months. Over the years there has been some effort to replace/complement steam distribution loops with hot water distribution loops.\nAdditional info:\n\nThe Royal Navy’s conversion to oil is attributed to Winston Churchill.\nOtto Diesel’s first big marketing gig was the 1924 World’s Fair\nMark Foster’s paternal grandfather came to Alaska in the 1940s following work on hydro projects on the Columbia River in WA and worked on building coal fired power plants with steam heat distribution systems at UAF, FMUS, and Ft. Wainwright.\nSee: Davis, T. N., 1984, Energy/Alaska: Fairbanks, AK, University of Alaska Press, 530 p.",

    "text": "C.1 Complexity\nThe Open Energy Ontology OEO defines an electrical grid as a supply grid that is an aggregate of material entities such as power stations and power lines. Some data can only be reported at the grid level, meaning that once a power station inputs electricity into a grid, we cannot know which community finally consumes that power and all communities must be reported together. Clarifying these relationships for the AEDG display and correctly accounting for it in the data tables is tricky.\nIn Alaska’s environment of small isolated grids, multiple communities can be connected to the same grid or a community can be isolated on its own grid. The composition of a grid can change over time when, for instance, a community builds an intertie to an existing grid. In that case, a community could belong to multiple grids over time.\nThe relationship between grids and electrical utilities is also complex. In small communities, the grid and utility are essentially the same. However, some utilities (such as AVEC) have separate grids in each of the separate communities they serve. However, the Railbelt grid includes multiple electrical utilities serving communities in different portions of the grid.",

    "text": "C.2 Treatment\nFor his update to the Alaska Energy Statistics Workbooks, Neil McMahon has an intertie lookup table to link communities with grids. In that table, interties are identified with a unique identifier paired with a year that represents the last time a community was newly added to the grid. He then queried by that code to return a list of the communities.\nThe aim of AEDG is somewhat different, in that AEDG queries the data by community - probably for the current year but also maybe shifting to other years as well. Therefore, the format of our Grids table must have the community as the primary key. The example of the community of Mountain Village is used to describe how our tables work. Mountain Village had an isolated grid until 2020 when an intertie was built to connect it to an existing multi-community grid.\nIn this case, generation (with imaginary values) is reported by the grid id:\n\n\n\nyear\ngrid\ngeneration\n\n\n\n\n2019\n64\n30\n\n\n2019\n75\n100\n\n\n2020\n75\n130\n\n\n\nAnd the Mountain Village is described and switching from one grid to another. 9999 for final_year means the grid is still active in its present form. The connection_year 1985 is the earliest year for which we have information.\n\n\n\ncommunity (FIPS instead)\nconnection_year\nfinal_year\ngrid_id\n\n\n\n\nMountain Village\n1985\n2020\n64\n\n\nSt Mary’s\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nAndreafsky\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nPitkas Point\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nMountain Village\n2020\n9999\n75\n\n\n\nIf we are querying for generation with community = \"St Mary's\" & year = 2020, then the evolution of the grid is irrelevant. We just need to know if connection_year &lt;= year &lt; final_year so we know whether to grab generation for grid = 75. For community = \"Mountain Village\" we would get grid = 75 in 2020, but grid = 64 in 2019.\nIf we want to show all the communities associated with this generation value, then that query would be like: find all communities where grid_id = 75 & connection_year &lt;= year &lt; final_year. In 2019, this would return 3 communities and in 2020, it would return all 4.",

    "text": "0.1 Welcome\nThis repository aims to support needed conversations regarding a foundational element of Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG): the creation of derived aggregates of socio-economic and energy data at upper levels such as administrative regions and grids.\nTo accomplish the computation of these aggregates in a reproducible way, a cross-walk between conceptual groupings of communities is required. This conceptual model will be applicable to diverse types of data. It will also guide the development of the algorythms that compute the aggregations and convert between them.\nIf possible, this cross-walk will be machine readable/actionable. But to establish with consensus between our various subject matter experts, we need to start with a single set of definitions and axioms (rules) expressed in a human readable form. This could happen in a wiki, but we should maintain a record of revisions so we can document discussions and final recommendations. The best format for this process is a GitHub repo.",

For instance:\n\nBecause of interties, electricity is not always reported by individual communities.\nSome ways of avoiding personally identifiable information (such as for building footprints) involve reporting by zip code.\nExisting analysis such as [somebody’s] energy burden data is reported at census tract level.\n\nAlso, different audiences need data reported at different scales:\n\nCommunities want a summary of their own data.\nLegislative Aides want summaries by legislative district.\nAgency leads might want to compare PCE communities with railbelt communities.\n\nThe assumption is that this needs to function for the current time only. Of course, boundaries change over time, and that these changes are of interest to researchers. However, the main users of AEDG have been defined as requiring current data to support future projects or to determine the success of existing projects. Researchers can download data and work out time-dependent issues for themselves. In a future time, we might want to support this with a time-dependent version of this system, but now is not that time.",

Problems will be raised and solutions will be suggested.\nWhen consensus has been reached (which might happen in an offline discussion), the resolution will be recorded in the issue, revisions made to this web book, and the issue closed.\nAfter the most substantive discussions have been resolved, Liz will attempt to translate this ontology into the OWL ontology language.\nIf that does not work, we will try a relational database for consistency with other AEDG products.\nIf the concepts do not resolve into a relational database, we can try a graph database. We might want to leave this option open for visualization possibilities.\n\nWhenever possible, we will rely on existing resources and resist defining our own ontology from scratch. Hopeful candidates are:\n\nDarwin Core\nOBO Relations Ontology\n\nAs of Nov. 2024, it is unclear how to make use of an OWL formated ontology with code. If this becomes problematic, we reserve the right to use a relational database instead based on our greater familiarity with that tech.

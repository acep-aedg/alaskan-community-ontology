    "text": "0.1 Welcome\nThis repository aims to support needed conversations regarding a foundational element of Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG): the creation of derived aggregates of socio-economic and energy data at upper levels such as administrative regions and grids.\nTo accomplish the computation of these aggregates in a reproducible way, a cross-walk between conceptual groupings of communities is required. This conceptual model will be applicable to diverse types of data. It will also guide the development of the algorithms that compute the aggregations and convert between them.\nIf possible, this cross-walk will be machine readable/actionable. But to establish with consensus between our various subject matter experts, we need to start with a single set of definitions and axioms (rules) expressed in a human readable form. This could happen in a wiki, but we should maintain a record of revisions so we can document discussions and final recommendations. The best format for this process is a GitHub repo.",

If they are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), then that is what distinguishes an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.\n\nRelations are the edges in a graph.\nIn a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.\n\nAxioms: Domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.\n\nAxioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include x = y and y = z, trying to enter an x that isn’t equal to z would fail a test.",

Hopeful candidates are:\nSchema.org is a widely used classification scheme built around web semantics - so more applicable to internet based services, of which AEDG is one.\nDublin Core Metadata Terms (DCMT) are limited to only the most necessary terms. For instance, dc:Location is defined to include both spatial regions and named places, and puts no qualifications on the type or context. Similarly, an dc:Agent is merely “a resource that acts or has the power to act”. Wikipedia says: “Initially developed as fifteen terms in 1998 the set of elements has grown over time and in 2008 was redefined as a Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary.”\nOpen Energy Ontology (OEO), which can be accessed via this Terminology Service.\nThe Census Glossary describes the terms associated with the census.\nTerms describing Alaska Native representation are complex.

    "text": "C.1 What is Aurora Energy LLC?\nTo illustrate the questions that arise with utilities that serve multiple parts of the energy market and the relationships between Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the Load Serving Entities that distribute power to customers, this page considers the case of Aurora Energy LLC in Fairbanks. It also illustrates the development of plants and operators in Fairbanks over time because knowing that history is important.\nThese questions were not addressed adequately by the previous version of AEDG. In the AEDG dashboard for Fairbanks, Aurora Energy is categorized as one of many electrical utilities and no mention is made of the other utilities that serve Fairbanks. Here is a screenshot of that display:\nTo add more context that can bee applied to AEDG v3, this page draws upon legal definitions and information from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA). Additional information came from subject matter experts Steve Colt and Mark Foster; their responses in an email exchange in Feb. 2025 have been edited here for clarity.\nAurora Energy is a company that owns and operates the coal fired power plant in downtown Fairbanks; it has also been called Aurora Power. This plant generates electricity, and it also generates heat which is distributed to customers in the downtown area.\nAurora Energy is regulated by the RCA (CPCN 520), which gives it “Authority to operate as an electric utility to furnish electric energy to Golden Valley Electric Association, Inc.,”. But there is another certificate (CPCN 119) that describes it as a public utility providing steam heat with a service area of “The corporate limits of the City of Fairbanks, Alaska, as of July 1, 1970.”\nTherefore, Aurora Energy is both:\nAurora Energy is one of the successor entities to the Fairbanks Municipal Utilities System (FMUS) that served downtown Fairbanks for decades. FMUS also provided district heat through pipes, as steam. Coal fired power plants that generated heat and electricity were common across small campuses around the Northern United States. A similar entity was Anchorage Municipal Light and Power which served downtown Anchorage.",

    "text": "C.2 What is Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA)?\nThe Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA) is a non-profit electric cooperative membership corporation whose mission is to “safely provide its member-owners with reliable electric service, quality customer service, and innovative energy solutions at fair and reasonable prices.” GVEA incorporated in 1946, and in about 1997, GVEA acquired the electricity transmission and distribution assets from FMUS and some of its generation assets.\nGVEA acquired the Frame 5 diesel fired generating units that were stationed adjacent to the FMUS Chena Power Plant from FMUS. But GVEA did not acquire the big coal plant on the Chena river; instead Aurora Energy came into being as an IPP, acquired that coal plant, and operates it now.\nGVEA is the final seller of electricity, or “Load-Serving Entity” (“LSE”), serving all of Fairbanks with some exceptions. GVEA only covers customers who have or pay for electric line extensions to their property/facilities. A number of customers within GVEA’s service territory continue to self-generate electricity in view of the expense of line extension costs. And for historic reasons, UAF and the military bases generate their own power (see below). GVEA’s role is convoluted: sometimes selling some electricity to the bases, sometimes buying electricity from UAF, and probably some other interesting behaviors.\nGVEA is regulated by the RCA (CPCN 13) and has a service area that covers Fairbanks and beyond.\nAdditional info:\n\nHenri Dale, retired from GVEA, will have details on GVEA’s acquisitions.\nWight, P.

    "text": "C.3 Are there other relevant utilities?\nFairbanks has more distributed power generation than other communities in part because of the evolution of the distribution of the power plants developed at University of Alaska Fairbanks, Ft. Wainwright, Eielson Air Force Base, and later additional GVEA operated power plants using diesel, HAGO, and naphtha generation resources at the North Pole refinery associated with completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) in 1977. In addition, there are, or have been, other energy utilities besides electrical utilities:\n\nThe Fairbanks Interior Gas Utility (IGU) is certificated to sell natural gas (CPCN 753)\nFairbanks Natural Gas LLC (CPCN 514) used to be the gas utility in the city of Fairbanks, but it is inactive now.\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks’s coal plant that makes both electricity and heat \nDoyon Utilities provides electric utility service for Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks (CPCN 726)\nDoyon Utilities also serves as a heat utility for Fort Wainwright (CPCN 725)\nFairbanks is connected to the Railbelt and so purchases power from other connected utilities.\n\n\nC.3.1 A note on technology\nFor decades, Fairbanks used smaller scale wood and nascent oil/diesel. These were replaced with combined heat-power plants that imported stoker fired traveling grate coal feeds into a boiler technology adapted from the shipping industry that later converted to oil. Fairbanks imported this relatively efficient form of heat-power energy production roughly contemporaneous with WWII and the influx of federal Department of Defense money. The steam distribution systems also provided humidification in the dry winter months. Over the years there has been some effort to replace/complement steam distribution loops with hot water distribution loops.",

    "text": "D.1 Complexity\nThe Open Energy Ontology OEO defines an electrical grid as a supply grid that is an aggregate of material entities such as power stations and power lines. Some data can only be reported at the grid level, meaning that once a power station inputs electricity into a grid, we cannot know which community finally consumes that power and all communities must be reported together. Clarifying these relationships for the AEDG display and correctly accounting for it in the data tables is tricky.\nIn Alaska’s environment of small isolated grids, multiple communities can be connected to the same grid or a community can be isolated on its own grid. The composition of a grid can change over time when, for instance, a community builds an intertie to an existing grid. In that case, a community could belong to multiple grids over time.\nThe relationship between grids and electrical utilities is also complex. In small communities, the grid and utility are essentially the same. However, some utilities (such as AVEC) have separate grids in each of the separate communities they serve. However, the Railbelt grid includes multiple electrical utilities serving communities in different portions of the grid.",

    "section": "D.2 Treatment",
    "text": "D.2 Treatment\nFor his update to the Alaska Energy Statistics Workbooks, Neil McMahon has an intertie lookup table to link communities with grids. In that table, interties are identified with a unique identifier paired with a year that represents the last time a community was newly added to the grid. He then queried by that code to return a list of the communities.\nThe aim of AEDG is somewhat different, in that AEDG queries the data by community - probably for the current year but also maybe shifting to other years as well. Therefore, the format of our Grids table must have the community as the primary key. The example of the community of Mountain Village is used to describe how our tables work. Mountain Village had an isolated grid until 2020 when an intertie was built to connect it to an existing multi-community grid.\nIn this case, generation (with imaginary values) is reported by the grid id:\n\n\n\nyear\ngrid\ngeneration\n\n\n\n\n2019\n64\n30\n\n\n2019\n75\n100\n\n\n2020\n75\n130\n\n\n\nAnd the Mountain Village is described and switching from one grid to another. 9999 for final_year means the grid is still active in its present form. The connection_year 1985 is the earliest year for which we have information.\n\n\n\ncommunity (FIPS instead)\nconnection_year\nfinal_year\ngrid_id\n\n\n\n\nMountain Village\n1985\n2020\n64\n\n\nSt Mary’s\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nAndreafsky\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nPitkas Point\n1985\n9999\n75\n\n\nMountain Village\n2020\n9999\n75\n\n\n\nIf we are querying for generation with community = \"St Mary's\" & year = 2020, then the evolution of the grid is irrelevant. We just need to know if connection_year &lt;= year &lt; final_year so we know whether to grab generation for grid = 75. For community = \"Mountain Village\" we would get grid = 75 in 2020, but grid = 64 in 2019.\nIf we want to show all the communities associated with this generation value, then that query would be like: find all communities where grid_id = 75 & connection_year &lt;= year &lt; final_year. In 2019, this would return 3 communities and in 2020, it would return all 4.",

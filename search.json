    "text": "0.1 Welcome\nThis repository aims to support needed conversations regarding a foundational element of Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG): the creation of derived aggregates of socio-economic and energy data at upper levels such as administrative regions and grids.\nTo accomplish the computation of these aggregates in a reproducible way, a cross-walk between conceptual groupings of communities is required. This conceptual model will be applicable to diverse types of data. It will also guide the development of the algorythms that compute the aggregations and convert between them.\nIf possible, this cross-walk will be machine readable/actionable. But to establish with consensus between our various subject matter experts, we need to start with a single set of definitions and axioms (rules) expressed in a human readable form. This could happen in a wiki, but we should maintain a record of revisions so we can document discussions and final recommendations. The best format for this process is a GitHub repo.",

    "text": "0.2 Goal\nTo provide a basis for tranformation of data provided at different scales so that multiple groupings can be displayed on AEDG dashboards.\nThis is required because data will provided at different scales. For instance:\n\nBecause of interties, electricity is not always reported by individual communities.\nSome ways of avoiding personally identifiable information (such as for building footprints) involve reporting by zip code.\nExisting analysis such as [somebody’s] energy burden data is reported at census tract level.\n\nAlso, different audiences need data reported at different scales:\n\nCommunities want a summary of their own data.\nLegislative Aides want summaries by legislative district.\nAgency leads might want to compare PCE communities with railbelt communities.\n\nThe assumption is that this needs to function for the current time only. Of course, boundaries change over time, and that these changes are of interest to researchers. However, the main users of AEDG have been defined as requiring current data to support future projects or to determine the success of existing projects. Researchers can download data and work out time-dependent issues for themselves. In a future time, we might want to support this with a time-dependent version of this system, but now is not that time.",

Other Classes (Borough, AEARegion, ZipCode) will be defined in relation to Community.\n\nClasses could be translated to tables in a relational database, if that makes sense for development.\nInstances of a Class are nodes in a graph, if you think about things that way.\n\nProperties: These are attributes of the Classes.\n\nProperties could take the form of columns in tables in a relational database.\n\nRelations: These can be heirarchical (taxonomy) or could form a network or graph (semantic web) of the various entities. If they are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), then that is what distinguishs an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.\n\nRelations are the edges in a graph.\nIn a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.\n\nAxioms: Domain-specific rules that encapsulate what we know about the Classes.\n\nAxioms could form the basis of quality checks to entered data or the definition of the ontology. For instance, if the axioms include x = y and y = z, trying to enter an x that isn’t equal to z would fail a test.",

Problems will be raised and solutions will be suggested.\nWhen consensus has been reached (which might happen in an offline discussion), the resolution will be recorded in the issue, revisions made to this web book, and the issue closed.\nAfter the most substantive discussions have been resolved, Liz will attempt to translate this ontology into the OWL ontology language.\nIf that does not work, we will try a relational database for consistency with other AEDG products.\nIf the concepts do not resolve into a relational database, we can try a graph database. We might want to leave this option open for visualization possibilities.\n\nWhenever possible, we will rely on existing resources and resist defining our own ontology from scratch. Hopeful candidates are:\n\nDarwin Core\nOBO Relations Ontology\n\nAs of Nov. 2024, it is unclear how to make use of an OWL formated ontology with code. If this becomes problematic, we reserve the right to use a relational database instead based on our greater familiarity with that tech. Ontology specific work can be delayed to future development cycles.",

If new regions are defined, they can be included, but this is intended to be either AEA’s 11 regions or ACEP’s 3 regions (Coastal, PCE, or Railbelt).\nProperties:\n\norganizaton (string): ‘ACEP’ or ‘AEA’ as the origanization that defined the region.\nboundary (WKT Polygon): A spatial boundary does not make sense because these were used to group communities together, and in the case of ACEP’s regions, they were intended to be discontinuous. Meaning, there are some PCE communities that are pretty near the coast because the designation is based on power costs and not geography.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.9 CensusBlock\n\nDefinition: TBA\nProperties:\n\n\n\n2.3.10 CensusTract\n\nDefinition: TBA\nProperties:\n\n\n\n2.3.11 Grid\n\nDefinition: An entity that provides electricity to a Community.

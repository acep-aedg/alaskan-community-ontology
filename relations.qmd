Relations can be hierarchical (taxonomy) or could form a network or graph (semantic web) of the various entities. These are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), and that defines an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.

  - Relations are the edges in a graph.
  - In a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.


## Applicable Standards

[ArcMap spatial relations](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/using-sql-with-gdbs/relational-functions-for-st-geometry.htm)

- ST_Contains
- ST_Crosses
- ST_Disjoint
- ST_Equals
- ST_Intersects
- ST_Overlaps
- ST_Relate
- ST_Touches
- ST_Within

[GeoSPARQL](https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html) - same except for Relate

- geor:sfContains
- geor:sfCrosses
- geor:sfDisjoint
- geor:sfEquals
- geor:sfIntersects
- geor:sfOverlaps
- geor:sfTouches
- geor:sfWithin

[OBO Relations Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ro?tab=properties) "is a collection of OWL relations (ObjectProperties) intended for use across a wide variety of biological ontologies." It is a foundational element of the [Open Energy Ontology](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/).

On the other hand, in the OEO [Terminology Service](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/oeo/props), I could only find one instance of a straight-up `RO` usage: [is homeomorphic for](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/oeo/props?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FRO_0040042) (which I don't even understand).

## Relations

### Spatial Relations

Most relationships can be established dynamically through spatial relations. We do not need to have a lookup table of Communities in Boroughs, say, because we can select all the Community points that the Borough CONTAINS. The primary relationships are sketched out on the Classes pages, but the combinations are really unlimited.

### Lookup Tables

Some classes are legal or corporate entities and so do not have an intrinsic spatial component. But they serve other entities that _do_ have a spatial component, so we will use look-up tables to attach spatial info to them.

Table names are very specific so that they describe the exact relationship between the entities. This will self-document the queries when those are written.

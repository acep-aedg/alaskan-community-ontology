Relations can be heirarchical (taxonomy) or could form a network or graph (semantic web) of the various entities. These are based on domain specific rules (Axioms), and that defines an ontology. Relations enable AI to infer new information without people having to explicitly define everything.

  - Relations are the edges in a graph.
  - In a relational database, Relations can be encoded using a lookup table with a combination of foreign keys.


## Applicable Standards

[ArcMap spatial relations](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/using-sql-with-gdbs/relational-functions-for-st-geometry.htm)

- ST_Contains
- ST_Crosses
- ST_Disjoint
- ST_Equals
- ST_Intersects
- ST_Overlaps
- ST_Relate
- ST_Touches
- ST_Within

[GeoSPARQL](https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html) - same except for Relate

- geor:sfContains
- geor:sfCrosses
- geor:sfDisjoint
- geor:sfEquals
- geor:sfIntersects
- geor:sfOverlaps
- geor:sfTouches
- geor:sfWithin

[OBO Relations Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ro?tab=properties) "is a collection of OWL relations (ObjectProperties) intended for use across a wide variety of biological ontologies." It is a foundational element of the [Open Energy Ontology](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/).

On the other hand, in the OEO [Terminology Service](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/oeo/props), I could only find one instance of a straight-up `RO` usage: [is homeomorphic for](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/oeo/props?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FRO_0040042) (which I don't even understand).

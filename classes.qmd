## Classes

Classes are types of entities. The base Class is Community; dispite the fact that this might be the hardest Class to define, Community is the organizational principle of previous versions of AEDG, so we will start with that. Other Classes (Borough, AEARegion, ZipCode) will be defined in relation to Community. 

  - Classes could be translated to tables in a relational database, if that makes sense for development. 
  - Instances of a Class are nodes in a graph, if you think about things that way.
  - Classes are typically capitolized to differentiate them from instances or objects of that class, which are lower case.

This page also includes Properties, which are attributes of the Classes. 

  - Properties could take the form of columns in tables in a relational database.

## Common Properties

These are attributes shared by all Classes

- id (int): All Classes should have an id column for inclusion in lookup tables. 
  - How we determine these is a whole 'nother thing.
- label (string): Human readable name. This cannot be the key of the table becaues multiple Classes could have the same label (example: Fairbanks the Municipality and Fairbanks the Borough)
- classModificationDate (time): Classes will evolve as we evaluate their effectiveness, so we should record when the class definition changes to identify which Classes might need reevaluation. 
- entityModificationDate (time): This is to allow evolution in time, which we do not plan to utilize in the first development cycle of AEDG.
- geometry (geom): As it is developing, each of these entities seems to have spatial component, though it might be a Point, Polygon, or Line.


# List of Classes

## AEDG Context Only

### Community

  - location (WKT Point): longitude, latitude of the place. Perhaps the commonly accepted point or centroid of.


### CensusDesignatedPlace

- **Definition**: CDPs are statistical equivalents of incorporated places and represent unincorporated communities that do not have a legally defined boundary or an active, functioning governmental structure.

- **Properties**:
  - location (WKT Point): longitude, latitude points of whereever the census says it is


### Borough

- **Definition**: Boroughs are analagous to a county in other places. Organized boroughs were formed in those areas where economies were better developed. The remaining areas are the unorganized borough, which is divided into census areas; these areas exist for statistical analysis and do not have a government of their own. There are also consolidated city-borough governments.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/GovernmentOrganization
  - has an https://schema.org/AdministrativeArea

## Statistical or Research Context

### CensusBlock

- **Definition**: Census blocks are the smallest level of geography you can get basic census demographic data for, such as total population by age, sex, and race.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/DefinedRegion - Arbitrary!  haha
- **References**:
  - https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html
  - https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geopackage-file.html
  - https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html
  - https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/article/maps-gis-data
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the census block.


### CensusTract

- **Definition**: Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity that provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/DefinedRegion - Arbitrary!  haha
- **References**:
  - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13
  - https://esri.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=20f5d275113e4066bf311236d9dcc3d4
  - https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/article/maps-gis-data
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the census tract.


### Region

- **Definition**: Communities have been grouped into Regions in order to summarize energy trends in the Energy Statistics Workbooks or the Alaska Electricity Trends Report (2024). If new regions are defined, they can be included, but this is intended to be either AEA's 11 regions or ACEP's 3 regions (Coastal, PCE, or Railbelt).  Note: if we need to translate between AEA and ACEP regions, we will need to separate these.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/DefinedRegion - Arbitrary!  haha
- **Properties**:
  - organizaton (string): 'ACEP' or 'AEA' as the origanization that defined the region. 
  - ~~boundary (WKT Polygon):~~ A spatial boundary does not make sense because these were used to group communities together, and in the case of ACEP's regions, they were intended to be discontinuous. Meaning, there are some PCE communities that are pretty near the coast because the designation is based on power costs and not geography.


## Energy Context

### Grid
- **Definition**: An entity that provides electricity to a Community. Includes generation and distribution, and is typically categorized by capacity.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - TBD
- **Properties**:
  - microgrid (boolean): True/False (need a definition for this)
  - capacity (int): 


### Utility Service Area
- **Definition**: The corporate entity that runs the Grid
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - TBD
- **Properties**:
  - coop (boolean): True/False is it organized as a member owned co-operative?
  - private (boolean): True/False is it a private company?
  - ~~Boundary (WKT Polygon)~~: I feel like a spatial version of a corporate entity does not make sense. Especially for AVEC, whose region is discontinuous.


### Intertie
- **Definition**: The transmission lines that create a Grid that includes multiple Communities
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - TBD
- **Properties**:
  - path (WKT Line): longitude, latitude points that trace an acceptible, if not accurate, route of the lines.
  - owner (string): Who owns it?
  - maintainer (string): Who maintains it? Is this the same as Owner?


## Optional

### CensusArea
- **Definition**: Census areas are subdivisions of the unorganized borough that are only used for statistical analysis and do not have a government of their own. These are typically undeveloped areas, so I'm not sure how relevant they are for AEDG.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/DefinedRegion - Arbitrary!  haha
- **References**:
  - https://gis.data.alaska.gov/datasets/DCCED::alaska-borough-and-census-area-boundaries/about
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the census area.


### ZipCode

- **Definition**: Postal zip codes as available from [link] (ZCTA)
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/DefinedRegion - properties of which were designed for zip codes
- **References**:
  - https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/US/AK/alaska.html (place = town, Admin2 = borough?)
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the house district.


### SchoolDistrict

- **Definition**: Community based school districts. This might be out of scope or better handled as research.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - TBD
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the school district. This is too much to expect, probably.


### PowerPlant

- **Definition**: Entities that generate electricity for grids. This might be so complex that is it better handled by a different system.
- **Analogeous Standards**:
  - https://schema.org/GovernmentOrganization
  - has an https://schema.org/AdministrativeArea
- **Properties**:
  - fuel (string): OK. now I know this belongs elsewhere, because fuel type should be a lookup table and that doesn't belong with communities. Perhaps already handled by the Open Energy Ontology.

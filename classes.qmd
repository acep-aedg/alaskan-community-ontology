## Classes

Classes are types of entities. The base Class is Community; dispite the fact that this might be the hardest Class to define, Community is the organizational principle of previous versions of AEDG, so we will start with that. Other Classes (Borough, AEARegion, ZipCode) will be defined in relation to Community. 

  - Classes could be translated to tables in a relational database, if that makes sense for development. 
  - Instances of a Class are nodes in a graph, if you think about things that way.
  - Classes are typically capitolized to differentiate them from instances or objects of that class, which are lower case.

This page also includes Properties, which are attributes of the Classes. 

  - Properties could take the form of columns in tables in a relational database.

## Common Properties

These are attributes shared by all Classes

- id (int): All Classes should have an id column for inclusion in lookup tables. 
  - How we determine these is a whole 'nother thing.
- label (string): Human readable name. This cannot be the key of the table becaues multiple Classes could have the same label (example: Fairbanks the Municipality and Fairbanks the Borough)
- classModificationDate (time): Classes will evolve as we evaluate their effectiveness, so we should record when the class definition changes to identify which Classes might need reevaluation. 
- entityModificationDate (time): This is to allow evolution in time, which we do not plan to utilize in the first development cycle of AEDG.
- geometry (geom): As it is developing, each of these entities seems to have spatial component, though it might be a Point, Polygon, or Line.


## List of Classes

### Community

- **Definition**: Construct of AEDG that is the fundamental unit of displays and dashboards. 
- **Properties**:
  - location (WKT Point): longitude, latitude of the Community for convenience of display. Perhaps the centroid of the Municipality or a commonly accepted "place".


### Municipality

- **Definition**: Administrative entity for a town, city, or village. 
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the town


### VillageCorp

- **Definition**: Alaska Native village corporations were created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and are organized around small communities in Alaska that typically stemmed from traditional Alaska Native land. Village corporations were intended to to select lands on which any part of the village was located.

  - https://ancsa.lbblawyers.com/native-corporations.htm (list of 179)
  - https://ancsaregional.com/about-ancsa/#mandates
- **Properties**:
  - location (WKT Point): longitude, latitude of tribal leadership location
  - Additional properties should be determined by what is important to the people.


### Borough

- **Definition**: Boroughs are analagous to a county in other places. Organized boroughs were formed in those areas where economies were better developed. The remaining areas are the unorganized borough, which is divided into census areas; these areas exist for statistical analysis and do not have a government of their own. There are also consolidated city-borough governments.

  - https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/dcra/LocalBoundaryCommission
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska
- **Properties**:
  - type (string): "Unified Home Rule", "Non-unified Home Rule", "First Class", "Second Class"
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the Borough


### HouseDistrict

- **Definition**: Alaska state House districts as available from [link]
- **Properties**:
  - [wassit] (int): digit that denotes the district
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the house district.


### SenateDistrict

- **Definition**: Alaska state Senate districts as available from [link]
- **Properties**:
  - [wassit] (character): Capitol letter that denotes the district
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the house district.


### RegionalCorp

- **Definition**: Alaska Native regional corporations were created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and are organized around geographic areas defined by the common heritage and shared interests of the indigenous peoples. The boundaries of these areas do not directly represent land ownership, but instread define the areas in which each regional corporation could select lands to be conveyed under the provisions ANCSA.

  - https://ancsa.lbblawyers.com/native-corporations.htm (list of 13)
  - https://ancsaregional.com/about-ancsa/#mandates
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the RegionalCorp.
  - Additional properties should be determined by what is important to the people.


### Region

- **Definition**: Definitions of regions that have been used to summarize energy trends in the Energy Statistics Workbooks or the Alaska Electricity Trends Report (2024). If new regions are defined, they can be included, but this is intended to be either AEA's 11 regions or ACEP's 3 regions (Coastal, PCE, or Railbelt).
- **Properties**:
  - organizaton (string): 'ACEP' or 'AEA' as the origanization that defined the region. 
  - ~~boundary (WKT Polygon):~~ A spatial boundary does not make sense because these were used to group communities together, and in the case of ACEP's regions, they were intended to be discontinuous. Meaning, there are some PCE communities that are pretty near the coast because the designation is based on power costs and not geography.


### CensusBlock

- **Definition**: TBA
- **Properties**:


### CensusTract

- **Definition**: TBA
- **Properties**:


### Grid
- **Definition**: An entity that provides electricity to a Community. Includes generation and distribution, and is typically categorized by capacity.
- **Properties**:
  - microgrid (boolean): True/False (need a definition for this)
  - capacity (int): 


### Utility Service Area
- **Definition**: The corporate entity that runs the Grid
- **Properties**:
  - coop (boolean): True/False is it organized as a member owned co-operative?
  - private (boolean): True/False is it a private company?
  - ~~Boundary (WKT Polygon)~~: I feel like a spatial version of a corporate entity does not make sense. Especially for AVEC, whose region is discontinuous.


### Intertie
- **Definition**: The transmission lines that create a Grid that includes multiple Communities
- **Properties**:
  - path (WKT Line): longitude, latitude points that trace an acceptible, if not accurate, route of the lines.
  - owner (string): Who owns it?
  - maintainer (string): Who maintains it? Is this the same as Owner?

## Optional

### ZipCode

- **Definition**: Postal zip codes as available from [link] (ZCTA)
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the house district.

### SchoolDistrict

- **Definition**: Community based school districts. This might be out of scope or better handled as research.
- **Properties**:
  - boundary (WKT Polygon): longitude, latitude points that denote the boundary of the school district. This is too much to expect, probably.


### PowerPlant

- **Definition**: Entities that generate electricity for grids. This might be so complex that is it better handled by a different system.
- **Properties**:
  - fuel (string): OK. now I know this belongs elsewhere, because fuel type should be a lookup table and that doesn't belong with communities. Perhaps already handled by the Open Energy Ontology.
